## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is a monorepo with two main directories:
- `/client`: Contains the entire React frontend application.
- `/backend`: Contains the Node.js/Express backend server and API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- `npm`
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account for the database.
- A [Deepgram](https://developers.deepgram.com/) API Key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd APP_TRANSLATOR
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    # Deepgram API Configuration
    DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY_HERE"
    DEEPGRAM_API_URL="https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"

    # MongoDB Connection String (from MongoDB Atlas)
    MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"

    # JWT Secret for Authentication
    JWT_SECRET="A_VERY_LONG_AND_COMPLEX_SECRET_PHRASE"

    # Server Configuration
    PORT=3001
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    - In a terminal at the `/backend` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    - The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    - In another terminal at the `/client` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    - The application will open and be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üìù API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints:

-   `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
-   `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in a user and receive a JWT.
-   `POST /api/transcripts/upload`: (Protected) Upload or record audio for transcription.
-   `GET /api/transcripts`: (Protected) Get the authenticated user's transcription history.
